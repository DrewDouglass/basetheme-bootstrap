# Base Theme by SparkyCode Collect

## Major Updates
The theme has been updated to reflect recent practices and libraries.

###Bootstrap4
Bootstrap 4 is now included by default. Yay flexbox.

###jQuery 3.x
Bootstrap uses jQuery 3.x SLIM. This theme does not, it uses the full powered jQuery 3.x library as we've found many external libraries and scripts cannot work with slim.

###Popper
Bootstrap now requires Popper library.
