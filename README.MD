# Base Theme by Drew Douglass - SparkyCode LLC

## Major Updates
The theme has been updated to reflect recent practices and libraries.

### Bootstrap4
Bootstrap 4 is now included by default. Yay flexbox.

### jQuery 3.x
Bootstrap uses jQuery 3.x SLIM. This theme does not, it uses the full powered jQuery 3.x library as we've found many external libraries and scripts cannot work with slim.

### Popper
Bootstrap now requires Popper library.

## Install
Update the main style.css with your theme info. Upload the folder to your themes folder. Activate the theme.

## Recommended Plugins
This theme when activated will show a list of recommend plugins that you can install with 1 click.
I highly recommend you do so, especially with UpDraftPlus (backup plugin that can send automated backups to remote storage).
